<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I love MMA. Its been a passion of mine since i was young and at the age of 6 i started training Muay Thai. 
From then i continued to train Muay Thai but then also included boxing when i turned 15.
I did boxing for around a year and a half and then i wanted to do something new. I then started training 
brazillian jiu jitsu and im currently still doing it. It has been over a year and a half since i have 
started and im thinking of carrying this on for many more years. The end goal is to have done enough types of 
martial arts so that i am skilled in all areas in a fight.</p>

<p>Additionaly, since i was little, i have always loved playing games. It all started from when i was little 
and my sister and cousin (who is my brother basically) used to give me a dead controller and let me "play". I had
no clue i werent the one playing. Now i would say playing games is something that relaxes my body and mind and is a nice break
from the world. Its also a nice way for me to socialise and talk to my friends. My favourite three games are:
1. Overwatch  2. Black ops 6  3. Apex Legends</p>

<p>Funny fact about me, im a very picky eater. You would think any kid or teenager when growing up would love cake, sweets, 
chocolate, fizzy drinks etc. But for me that werent the case. My favourite things to eat was a Margherita Pizza, 
anything to do with Chicken, but not too fancy, and of course, since i live in the UK, Fish and Chips. Now my pickiness when it comes
to eating its not too bad. i like a more of a variety of things but i still dont like cake, sweets, chocolates, fizzy drinks etc.
I used to be SO picky as a kid that my cereal used to be crushed doritos in a bowl. Obviously that wasnt a regular occurence.</p>
